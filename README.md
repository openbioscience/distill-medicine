Distilling the current knowledge of diseases to find cures.

## about

Currently, disease research is dispersed across a wide variety of data sources
and papers. No resource yet has distilled that research into the current knowns
and unknowns, with corresponding hypotheses to test.

This online publication is an attempt to consolidate information on currently
incurable diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and spinocerebellar
ataxia (all forms).
